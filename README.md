📊 Retail Customer Segmentation Analysis with K-Means
🚀 Project Overview
In this project, we perform customer segmentation analysis on an online retail dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By leveraging clustering techniques and data preprocessing, we identify distinct customer groups to drive actionable business insights and optimize marketing strategies. This project highlights the use of data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, clustering analysis, and visualization.
